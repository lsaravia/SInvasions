
Stochastic/deterministic invasion model 
===================================================

This is C++ code for spatially explicit simulation of an invasion process of a woody specie with a simple two stage structure juvenile/adults. 

The details of the models are in;

I am using GCC to compile it. For a crude and slow graphical output you will need the X11 SDL development libraries and the GRX graphics library http://grx.gnu.de/grx246um.htm

You also need the code from https://github.com/lsaravia/SpatialAnalysis.
